## About the project 📝

Since React Scheduler already provides ready-made components, I didn't see the point in dividing them into smaller ones, e.g. in the src/components folder, as I usually do. It's a simple application and didn't require much knowledge of React, more familiarity with the React Scheduler library. The task was simple, but I expected something more advanced to show my skills in React, e.g. custom components, custom hooks, or global state management.
